## Installation

1. Clone this repository.
2. Download the latest JavaFX SDK from [here](https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/).
3. Extract the downloaded SDK. Now open a new folder in C:\ drive named '<strong>Java</strong>' and copy that extracted SDK folder into the Java folder.
4. Now download Scene Builder from [here](https://gluonhq.com/products/scene-builder/) and install it.
5. Open Eclipse IDE, if not installed, download it from [here](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/installer).
6. From the menu bar, go to Help->Eclipse Marketplace.
7. Search for '<strong>fx</strong>' and press enter. Install the plugin with the name '<strong>e(fx)clipse</strong>'. You have to accept all the terms while installing.
8. Wait for the installation to complete and then restart the IDE.
9. From the menu bar, go to Window->Preferences.
10. In the Preferences window, search and click '<strong>JavaFX</strong>'.
11. The opened tab will require 2 input fields to fill as below:<br />
    a. SceneBuilder executable: Browse your installed SceneBuilder application (.exe) location.<br />
    E.g. **C:\Users\Lenovo\AppData\Local\SceneBuilder\SceneBuilder.exe**<br />
    b. JavaFX SDK: Go to your copied JavaFX SDK folder, open the '<strong>lib</strong>' folder in that, and copy-paste that directory path into this textbox.<br />
    E.g. **C:\Java\javafx-sdk-21.0.1\lib**
12. Restart the Eclipse IDE and open the cloned repository.
13. Go to [here](https://openjfx.io/openjfx-docs/). On the left panel of the website, look for the '<strong>JavaFX and Eclipse</strong>' tab and click it.
14. Scroll down to the 3rd point named '<strong>3. Add VM arguments</strong>'.
15. Switch to the '<strong>Windows</strong>' tab if you are a Windows user and copy the entire command.<br />
    E.g. **--module-path "\path\to\javafx-sdk-21.0.1\lib" --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml**
16. Come back to Eclipse, click on the down arrow located at the right of the '**Run**' button, and then click on '**Run Configurations...**'.
17. In a new window, click on the '**Java Application**' tab. See if any project configuration already exists. If doesn't, create a new configuration named '**MainApp**'.
18. Click on the configuration under the '**Java Application**' tab. Now switch to the '**Arguments**' tab on the right panel.
19. Paste that previously copied command in the '**VM arguments:**' textbox. In that command replace '**\path\to\javafx-sdk-21.0.1\lib**' with your actual JavaFX SDK lib location as previously found in 11.b.
20. Your command now will look something like '**--module-path "C:\Java\javafx-sdk-21.0.1\lib" --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml**'.
21. Finally click on the '**Apply**' button and you are now ready to run the application.
